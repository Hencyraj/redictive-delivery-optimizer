# 🚚 Delivery Delay Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts whether an order will be **delayed or delivered on time** using historical order data. The system trains a **Random Forest classifier** with proper data preprocessing and saves the trained model for future use.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes order delivery data to identify patterns that lead to delivery delays. It uses structured preprocessing pipelines for numerical and categorical features and builds a reliable classification model to predict delays.

The trained model is saved and can be reused in production or integrated into other applications.
